A simple command-line downloader for (Dell) BIOS Upgrades

```
Usage:
python biosupdate.py <output-folder>
```

``biosconfig.yaml`` defines the machine types for which BIOS upgrades should be downloaded.
The script also produces a ``results.json`` file with a mapping of machine types to their corresponding current BIOS versions.
